Project description: 
Implementing functions.


What I have accomplished to implement:
I managed to get functions to work along with return statements,
if statements, and different scopes. I hope to further expand my project
into assignment 6. Recursion currently functions and I've included some test
cases for that in this file.

The easiest part of this project:
The easiest part of this project was probably deciding on how I wanted to manage
my comparison nodes. Inheritance seemed like a natural idea for working with comparisons
due to my Object Oriented background and I'm also extremely lazy.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
I had a lot of different problems with this assignment. One of my biggest issues was tracking
scopes, working with the return nodes, and dealing with my augment assign issue where my implementation
broke with multiple scopes. I do believe I managed to fix this, however.
