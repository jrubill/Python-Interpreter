Project description: 
	Introduction to Hand In
	Giving a 300x300 image of myself 

The easiest part of this project:
	Figuring out who I should get a picture of.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
	Determining if I should write my name as Jeff, Jeffrey, or Jeffery. It's
	really difficult because I go by all of them :( Don't worry though! I 
	went with the one that had the shortest number of characters. That way 
	it's more convenient to you and safes space!
